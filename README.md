## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I thought the JavaScript portion of the page would be easier, but I didn't account for the logic needed to loop through an array inside an array. It was a humbling challenge for sure, but I'm really happy with how it turned out.

### Continued development

JavaScript it's my focus right now, but I will practice transitions because both the nav menu in mobile and, the sub-menu look a bit wonky for me. I also need to work on the logical side of JS because, at this point, a sub-menu will only collapse if you click on it again.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50278199/foreach-event-dropdown-menu-javascript) - This specific answer helped me with the looping over the sub-menu elements.
